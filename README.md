Husgruppen Cost Estimation Using ML
## Project Overview
This project aims to estimate construction costs based on input parameters such as wall area, number of floors, window quantities, door types, and other building specifications. The model is trained on historical construction data using multiple linear regression and other machine learning algorithms, which analyze the relationship between building features and final costs. The model's accuracy is evaluated using performance metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

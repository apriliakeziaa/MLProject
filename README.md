# MLProject
## Project Overview
This project aims to estimate construction costs based on input parameters such as wall area, number of floors, window quantities, door types, and other building specifications. The model is trained on historical construction data using multiple linear regression and other machine learning algorithms, which analyze the relationship between building features and final costs. The model's accuracy is evaluated using performance metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Dataset
The model uses historical construction data from Husgruppen's previous projects. Key features include:
- Wall area measurements
- Inner wall specifications
- Roof area
- Floor area
- Window quantities (standard and oversized)
- Door quantities (standard and sliding)
- Snow zone classification
- Delivery and mounting information

Note: The actual dataset cannot be shared publicly as it contains confidential business information.
